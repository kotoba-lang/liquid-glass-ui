(ns liquid-glass.components
  "Pure-hiccup liquid-glass primitives (.cljc, no reagent import) — the dual-render
  contract inherited from shitsuke: the same hiccup data renders via
  shitsuke.hiccup/->html (SSR) or reagent (browser).

  liquid-glass-ui owns no interaction/state logic of its own. Every component
  either wraps the matching `shitsuke.components` fn (button/icon-button/
  toolbar/mode-tabs/card/select keep their exact `act`/`:on-input`/etc.
  contract; see shitsuke.components docstrings) or, where shitsuke has no
  equivalent, is a small hiccup literal following the same `data-act`
  convention. The one deliberate exception: text-field/text-area/search-field
  build their native `<input>`/`<textarea>` directly instead of delegating to
  shitsuke.components/input|textarea — see `control-attrs` for the
  reagent-keystroke-loss bug that forced this (and the shitsuke follow-up).

  Every component whose top-level element IS the glass surface (panel/button/
  toolbar/sheet/text-field/menu-select/nav-bar/alert/menu/list/stepper/…)
  appends a `liquid-glass__specular` marker span (currently a no-op
  display:none anchor driven purely by the ::before CSS overlay in
  liquid-glass.style/component-css; reserved as the hook a future
  pointer-tracking enhancer or GPU/WebGPU refraction layer would target — see
  docs/design.md #future-work). Compound controls whose glass surface is a
  small *nested* box rather than the top-level element (toggle/checkbox/radio
  — the surface is the track/box span inside a `<label>`, and the native
  `<input>` needs to be the label's first child for click-to-toggle to work)
  skip the marker span rather than force it into a ~20px box; the CSS
  `::before` overlay on `-track`/`-box` still renders the glass sheen without it."

(defn- control-attrs
  "Attrs map for a native text control (`<input>`/`<textarea>`), built from
  caller opts. Every opt passes through untouched (:value :placeholder
  :on-key-down :disabled :aria-label :aria-describedby :maxLength :min :id
  :rows ...) except:

  - :class is dropped (it belongs to the *wrapper*; the control itself
    carries no class hook — the material CSS uses the
    `.liquid-glass__text-field input` descendant selector),
  - :act is mapped to :data-act (shitsuke's portable SSR interaction
    contract),
  - a caller :on-input is re-attached as :on-change when no :on-change is
    given (kept as-is when the caller wired both). React's `onChange` on text
    controls fires on the native `input` event, so the caller-visible
    semantics (per-keystroke, `(.. e -target -value)`) are identical — but
    the rename matters under reagent: reagent's async-rendering-safe
    controlled-input path (reagent.impl.input/input-render-setup) only
    engages when the props carry BOTH `value` and `onChange`. With
    :value + :on-input the control is a plain React controlled input under
    reagent's asynchronous (requestAnimationFrame-batched) re-rendering:
    after every keystroke React restores the DOM value to the last-*rendered*
    (stale) prop, so any keystroke that lands before the next render is typed
    into a reverted field and everything but the last keystroke is lost.
    Reproduced against reagent 1.2.0/React 18; reported live by net-babiniku
    (every text field, since its liquid-glass-ui adoption). Root cause lives
    in shitsuke.components/input|textarea (same :value + :on-input shape) —
    fixed here by building the control hiccup directly; shitsuke follow-up
    noted in the PR.

  never renders the string \"null\"), and omits :value entirely when the
